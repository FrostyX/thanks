* ~M-x thanks~

Say thanks to the authors of all your installed packages.

GitHub stars are meaningless internet points that don't provide any real-life
value, but at the same time, it is very much true that it warms developers'
hearts when you like their projects and give them a star as a form of
appreciation.

I promise you, by running ~M-x thanks~, you will make somebody's day better.

** Installation

This package is not in MELPA yet. Please install from upstream using
Quelpa (or your preferred package manager).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package thanks
  :quelpa (thanks
           :fetcher github
           :repo "FrostyX/thanks"
           :branch "main")
  :config
  (thanks-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Usage

Enable ~thanks-mode~ to automatically star all new packages as they are being
installed, or run ~M-x thanks~ command to star all your already installed
packages.

** Configuration

You shouldn't need to configure your GitHub API token. Try ~M-x
thanks-test-github-auth~ and only if unsuccessfull, see the
[[#troubleshooting][Troubleshooting section]].

You can exclude some of the installed packages from being stared:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq thanks-excluded-packages '("tramp-menu" "crontab-for-humans"))
#+END_SRC

** Troubleshooting

This package is built on top of [[https://github.com/sigma/gh.el][gh.el]], which can use existing API tokens from
your system. The chance is, you won't have to configure anything to make
~thanks~ work. Try running the ~M-x thanks-test-github-auth~ to make sure.

If the authentication failed, see if ~gh.el~ could find your token.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(gh-auth-get-oauth-token)
#+END_SRC

If not, see what token is being used by your official ~gh~ command.

#+BEGIN_SRC
gh auth status --show-token
#+END_SRC

And then set the token manually.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(gh-set-config "oauth-token" "supersecrettoken")
#+END_SRC

This package was inspired by [[https://github.com/jsongerber/thanks.nvim][jsongerber/thanks.nvim]] plugin for NeoVim.
